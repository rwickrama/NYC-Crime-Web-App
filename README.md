# NYC-Crime-Web-App

This project is based on the guided project Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python on Coursera. While the course itself focuses on a data set on vehilcle collisions, this code uses data on crimes in New York City. 

The data set can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/adamschroeder/crimes-new-york-city

I have used streamlit and python to visualize different types of crimes on a New York City map.
